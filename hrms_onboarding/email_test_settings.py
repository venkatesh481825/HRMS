# Temporary email settings for testing
# To use console backend (prints emails to console instead of sending):
# Change EMAIL_BACKEND in settings.py to:
# EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'

# Or use file backend (saves emails to files):
# EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend'
# EMAIL_FILE_PATH = BASE_DIR / 'sent_emails'
